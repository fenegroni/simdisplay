== Synopsis

The Simdisplay project contains everything you need to build and run a real simracing dashboard
showing telemetry information from the racing simulator Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC), in real time.

A Windows process reads data from ACC's shared memory telemetry and streams it to a supported device
running the embedded software which is also part of this project.

The only supported device at this time is any Arduino Uno R3 compatible board communicating over
a serial connection to the Windows 10 host running ACC.

The board must be wired to a number of LED's and a Hitachi 16x2 character display
to shows the relevant data, such as ABS and TC level, gear, redline RPM, etc.

== Hardware and Software

What makes this project interesting is that it is inexpensive
and can be assembled with very limited electronics and programming skills.

The whole process will be documented with wiring and assembly diagrams
as well as explanation of what the code does and the protocol used.

== Project folder outline

After cloning or downloading this repository, you will find two folders: `Device` and `Service`.

=== `Device`

Under `Device/UnoR3/arduino-ide/simdisplay` you will find the Arduino IDE project file `simdisplay.ino`.

This is the embedded software that will run on the Arduino Uno R3 board microcontroller:
it receives telemetry data from the Windows host via the USB-to-serial interface
and drives all the connected LEDs and the Hitachi 16x2 dot matrix character display.

You must build and upload this software to the Arduino Uno R3, and you must connect
all the devices the board before being able to see telemetry data.

The Arduino IDE is free software and can be downloaded from `https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software`
You can compile and upload the project to your Arduino board from the avialble Web Editor without
installing the IDE on your computer if you so wish.

For more information, refer to the README.adoc file in the folder `Device/UnoR3/arduino-ide`.

=== `Service`

Under `Service/Windows/visualstudio` you will find the Visual Studio 2019 solution file `simdisplay.sln`.

This is the Windows 64-bit Console application that will run on the Windows host
where ACC is installed and runs from.

For more information, refer to the `README.adoc` in the folder `Service/Windows/visualstudio`.
