= How to contribute to Simdisplay

We manage our project in a Kanban board on Trello:

https://trello.com/b/TgArFCJ1/simdisplay

The board is public but only contributors can add and resolve issues.

Take a look at the list of items in the Backlog column
and if you want to contribute, get in touch so we can track the item
you'd like to help with.
